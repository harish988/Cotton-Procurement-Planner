COTTON PROCUREMENT PLANNER THIAGARAJAR COTTON MILLS (P) LTD 

Version : 1.0

Description : It includes the backend of the application Thiagaraj Cotton Procurement Planner. It predicts the values of inventory stocks of each variety of cotton to be bought by the mill for the next three years by machine learning algorithms. The machine learning algorithm of MLP Regression is used in this application. It also provides graphical analysis of the cotton consumption from year to year.The factor that makes our project unique is inclusion marketing team prediction.

System Requirements : The system requires a RAM of minimum 512Mb and the additional packages to be installed along with python are IPython or Jupyter Notebook, numpy, scipy, scikit, matplotlib. You can install them by installing pip in the cmd in Windows. The alternate way is to simply download and install the Anaconda application as that includes all the required packages for an data scientist (except HMM algorithm in latest versions).

Note : The source folder an entire single module for all the types of cotton. Before implementing the module make sure that you have installed all the required components and open the module only in Ipython or Jupyter notebook. At first open the module you wanna run in a editor and change the location pointers that points to the excel and csv files into the location of the excel sheet present in your system else it will throw an exception.

Important Note:

The reason of using Multi Layer Perceptrons Regression Algorithm is because new variables can be added to the dataset at any time needed and priorities can be given to each and every variable so that when new variables can be added which gives more accurate value than before so that the work need not be started from base.
